                VCS, or Versioning Control System, is a system that controls different
                files in a situation where different people might be submitting different forms of the same file, it basically helps with file sharing.
                It tells a user who changed the file, when it was changed, what is different or nnew, and merge changes to the target file.
                It allows people to work together without file confliction due to files not being able to be over written and allows users to revert back to an older version of the file 
                in case anything happens.

            <p class="lead">
            A repository is esentially a database that the VCS, Versioning Control System, can use to help keep track of files.
            A repository can be local or remote. A local repository is basically the computer/computers that a user may use to write/change a file. If a file is only on the local repository than it cannot be 
                acessed through the remote repository or from any other computer that doens't already have that file. A remote repository is basically a cloud server where files from the local repository can be uploaded to. An exmample of when to use the 
                remote server is when a user uploads thier local copy of a file to the remote repository so that members of thier group may view and edit the file. Files that have been uploaded to the remote repository can still be changed depending on the users' actions
                and can be downloaded to local repositories for viewing and editing.

                Git is a free and open source VCS that was created in 2005. It allows users to have a copy of repository data on each computer. It is well optimized 
                and is user friendly with tutorials. Just like other VCS it allows the user to work without wory of overwritten files, but unlike other VCS
                becuase it is local you can work offline and simply upload it later when you do have connection to the internet. The fact that it is free and offers many 
                features, like staging areas and local branching, makes it a very popular VCS program. Unlike other VCS Git sees data and files as snapshots of the same file with different changes.
                Git also makes sure that no file is changed without Git knowing about it, to insure the safety and privacy of it's data. It's three main stages are the Working Directory, the Staging Area, and the Remote Repository.
